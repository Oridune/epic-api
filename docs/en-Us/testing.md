# Testing

Testing plays a crucial role in software development, being a necessary step for the deployment of production applications. Epic API offers a convenient solution for testing applications through its integrated Deno testing libraries. By default, Epic API leverages the Oak framework for handling requests, and its testing capabilities are readily configured with the superoak library.

Testing within this framework is straightforward and allows flexibility in choosing your preferred testing framework. There are no restrictions imposed by the framework, enabling you to seamlessly substitute specific elements like the test runner. Regardless of the chosen tools, you can still benefit from the pre-existing testing functionalities provided by the Epic API.
