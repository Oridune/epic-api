# Testing

Testing plays a crucial role in software development, a necessary step for deploying production applications. Epic API offers a convenient solution for testing applications through its integrated Deno testing libraries. By default, Epic API leverages the Oak framework for handling requests, and its testing capabilities are readily configured with the superoak library.

Testing within Epic API is straightforward and allows flexibility in choosing your preferred testing framework. The framework has no restrictions, enabling you to substitute specific elements like the test runner seamlessly. Regardless of the chosen tools, you can still benefit from the pre-existing testing functionalities provided by the Epic API.
