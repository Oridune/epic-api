# Plugins

Epic API revolutionizes the way developers build APIs by harnessing the power of a low-code architecture and employing a robust plugin system. With Epic API, developers can streamline their workflow, significantly reducing development time and effort while maintaining optimal flexibility and scalability. By providing a comprehensive set of tools and features.

Epic API empowers developers to create high-performance APIs with ease, enabling seamless integration, enhanced productivity, and accelerated application development. Whether you're a seasoned API developer or just starting your journey, Epic API empowers you to unlock the full potential of Deno.js and deliver exceptional, efficient, and reliable APIs.

In the context of Epic API, every project is treated as a plugin as long as it adheres to the specified plugin compatibility requirements. This concept closely resembles that of an npm module, where once installed, it seamlessly integrates and functions without any additional configuration.

Following is the bash command example to install an Epic API plugin:

```bash
# Execute the built-in Deno task

```
