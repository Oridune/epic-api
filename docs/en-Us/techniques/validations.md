# Validations

Epic API ships with a built-in validation library with a [Zod-like API](https://zod.dev/)! The reason for adding a built-in library instead of directly using an existing validation library was to provide a fully environment-integrated validator with some extra features that are not provided by other validation libraries. However, the developers still have the choice to use a validator of their choice.
