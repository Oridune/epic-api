# Environment variables

When developing any application, it is an excellent practice to manage your environment variables professionally. Similarly, when working with the Epic API, once you've cloned the repository, you must set up the environment variables before you begin working.

Epic API supports 3 environment types: **Development**, **Test,** and **Production**. You are required to execute the following command if the environment files don't already exist:

```bash
# Execute the built-in Deno task
deno task create:env -t development,test,production --randomString=123457890 --dbConnectionString="mongodb://localhost:27017/epic-api"
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** You can pass the environment variables directly in the command to auto-populate into the environment files. For example `--encryptionKey=123` or `--foo=bar`.
{% endhint %}

Once the above command executes, you will have a folder called env at the root of your project. If you look inside this folder, you will find 4 environment variable files:

* .env
* .production.env
* .development.env
* .test.env

{% hint style="info" %}
You may notice a `.env` file created by default from the above command! This is a global variables file. These variables will be available in all environment types, including development, production, and test.
{% endhint %}

### Working with the environment

Epic API framework exports a `Env` class that allows you to manage your environment configuration. See the following examples to understand how to use `Env` class.

#### How to get the current env type?

See the following code snippet on how to get the current environment type in Epic API:

```typescript
import { Env } from "@Core/common/mod.ts";

console.log(Env.getType()); // Logs: development | production | test
```

#### How to check for a specific env type?

The following example shows you how to check for a specific environment type:

```typescript
import { Env, EnvType } from "@Core/common/mod.ts";

console.log(Env.is(EnvType.DEVELOPMENT)); // Logs: true | false
```

#### How to access environment variables?

The `Env` class provides various methods to access environment variables. Each method has a specific use case. See the following examples:

```typescript
import { Env } from "@Core/common/mod.ts";

// Sync access
Env.getSync("your-key"); // This method will either return a string or throw an error if undefined.
Env.getSync("your-key", true); // returns string | undefined
```

The `Env` class also provides an Async method to access environment variables. This method is the recommended method to use when working with Epic API because it provides backup access to the environment variables using a caching server like Redis or a database. See the following examples:

```typescript
import { Env } from "@Core/common/mod.ts";

// Async access
await Env.get("your-key"); // This method will either return a string or throw an error if undefined.
await Env.get("your-key", true); // returns string | undefined
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Always use the `Env` class to access the environment variables. Avoid accessing the environment variables through `process.env` or `Deno.env` because these methods may not return all environment variables.
{% endhint %}

#### Handling missing environment variables

Epic APIâ€™s `Env` class offers a reliable mechanism for handling missing environment variables using a fallback method. This method allows you to retrieve missing variables from an external source, such as a database or an external API.

You can define a global fallback like this:

```typescript
import { Env } from "@Core/common/mod.ts";

Env.onGetFailed = async (key) => {
  const Value = await YourExternalSource.get(key) as string | null;
  return Value;
}
```

The `onGetFailed` function is triggered when `Env.get` cannot find a variable locally.

This fallback should be defined globally and initialized only once during the application's lifecycle.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Pro Tip:** You will have to use the [job module](overview/jobs.md) to assign a custom function for `onGetFailed` method.
{% endhint %}
